# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description

This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned

- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges

I had trouble importing a local image in my component jsx file. I was not writting the path correctly. I did some research on stack overflow and found some answers. I also could not figure out how to pass mulitple images from the parent component to the child component. I didn't figure that one out yet.
